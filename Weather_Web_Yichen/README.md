## Welcome to the Brand Labs Front End Developer Test ##

First and foremost, congratulations and thank you for taking this coding test.

This test is designed to showcase your technical skills as a developer in a practical example. While this test may seam simple, we have found best practices and good planning applies to project of any size. 

Lastly, please don't feel rushed to do this. While time is a factor in our review, it is only a small part of a larger set of items we look for.

### Test Description

We have a client that operates a travel agency and wants to build a simple destination weather checker
as a means of getting potential clients to consider traveling. 

### Test Requirements
* A form to enter a city name
* An integration with a weather API to get weather data
* Presenting the current weather information from the API
* Any supporting styling, libraries, etc
* The solution should contain HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### Test Documentation
* [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) - it is free with a simple account registration. We do recognize not every city is covered and as such will not critic the code during review for that as long as it functions otherwise.

### Test Guidelines
* The submitted page only needs to contain the above functionality - in other words don't worry about creating an entire page
to mimic a travel agency. Just provide the form and related functionality and styling.
* Coding is a representation of an individual - code as you think is best. We are not going to critic one library/framework/etc versus another
if the end goal is achieved properly.
* The answer should reflect current best practices for web sites
* The answer can be as simple or complex as needed
* Feel free to use any library, framework, etc you think is needed.
* Please feel free to reach out with questions
* While time is one part of a list of things we look at during review, do not feel rushed. Make sure you use enough time
to submit a good working solution
